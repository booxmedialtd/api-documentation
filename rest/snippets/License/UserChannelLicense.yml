            This optional key should not be present if startover service is not enabled.
            What sort of startover service is enabled.
            If "timeshift" returned: client don't need to switch to 0 position because live point is shifted and play will always start at beginning of shifted live point.
            If "DVR Window" returned: client may need to switch to 0 position of the playlist should it be required on the client requirement.
        trickplay_enabled:
          type: array
          description: >-
            An array of services that the user is allowed to use trickplay for on this channel.
            If a service does not appear in this array then trickplay is disabled for that service.
            Trickplay allows the user to pause, rewind, and fast-forward.
            Live channels cannot be fast-forwarded.  Trickplay allows the user to pause live television.
            Rewinding live television is treated as "startover service".

            type: string
            example: ["npvr"]
            enum: [live,npvr,catchup,startover]
