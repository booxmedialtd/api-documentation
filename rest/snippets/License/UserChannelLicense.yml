            An array of the service types that the user is entitled to for this channel
            Services may be one of [live,npvr,lpvr,catchup,startover]

          type: array
          description: >-
            An array of services that the user is allowed to use trickplay for on this channel.
            If a service does not appear in this array then trickplay is disabled for that service.
            Trickplay allows the user to pause, rewind, and fast-forward.
            Live channels cannot be fast-forwarded.  Trickplay allows the user to pause live television.
            Rewinding live television is treated as "startover service".

            enum: [live,npvr,lpvr,catchup,startover]
