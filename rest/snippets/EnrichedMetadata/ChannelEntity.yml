                  An Original_Network_ID (ONID) is defined as the “unique identifier of a network”.
                  Its main use is in the unique identification of a service through the path Original_Network_ID, Transport_Stream_ID.
                  Originally linked to Network_IDs, ONIDs should mainly be used for network operators, broadcasters and content producers.
