        The human readable description of the rule.  Multi-lingual support is enabled for this field.  The API will store
        multiple versions of this field, one for each language.  It will return the language that the client marks as
        acceptable in the request headers.  It will default onto the system configured default if the client does not
        indicate which language is acceptable and the "lang" parameter is omitted (where supported).
