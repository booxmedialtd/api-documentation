    This endpoint provides metadata about Programs.

    A program is something that can be shown.
    It could be a television show (like "Friends") or a movie (like "Die Hard") that appears on a Channel at a given time in a BroadcastSlot.
    It could equally be a VOD item that can be played on demand.
    The entity "Program" is a hook into the metadata system and does not include any information about when (or how) the thing can be played.  It's just information about what can be played.
