  description: |
    A BroadcastSlot is a time period on a Channel in which a Program may be shown.
    Our BroadcastSlot entity is just a single appearance of a Program on a Channel.
    We store information about the time slot as well as a title for the slot.
    Note: The title of a BroadcastSlot does not have to be the same as the title of the Program in that slot.
    In English a schedule is understood to be a list or a plan and so we avoid using that word for a single item.
