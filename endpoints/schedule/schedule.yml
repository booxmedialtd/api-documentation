  description: "A BroadcastSlot is a time period on a Channel in which a Program may be shown.
    Our BroadcastSlot entity is just a single appearance of a Program on a Channel.
    We store information about the time slot as well as a title for the slot.
    Note: The title of a BroadcastSlot does not have to be the same as the title of the Program in that slot.
    In English a schedule is understood to be a list or a plan and so we avoid using that word for a single item."

  description: |
    A channel is a source of content in the form of stream or signal, which can be watched / listened on a multimedia device.
    A channel is one of the elements that users can subscribe to.
    One Channel can be related to many BroadcastSlots which are placeholders in which a Program can be displayed.
    Channels have a lifetime which we refer to as "visibility".  Outside of this window the channel may not be watched.
    Although conceptually we could create a channel that holds a single program (for example a live event) this is not done in practice.
