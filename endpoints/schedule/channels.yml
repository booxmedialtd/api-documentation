    A channel is a source of content in the form of stream or signal, which can be watched / listened on a multimedia device.
    A channel is one of the elements that users can subscribe to.
    One Channel can be related to many BroadcastSlots which are placeholders in which a Program can be displayed.
    Channels have a lifetime which we refer to as "visibility".  Outside of this window the channel may not be watched.
    Although conceptually we could create a channel that holds a single program (for example a live event) this is not done in practice.
